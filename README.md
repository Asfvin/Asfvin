- 👋 Hi, I’m @Asfvin. I am currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer in an Insurance Company. Previously I worked as a Data Scientist and a Financial Analyst. 
- 👀 I’m interested in extracting and generating value from data, Economics and watching Movies
- 🌱 I’m currently learning deep learning, advanced time series, text analytics and software engineering/ architecture. My goal is to reduce my imposter syndrome and 
- become an excellent ML Practitioner.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on NLP, predictive pricing or NN models.
- 📫 How to reach me. Please email me at asfvin.p@gmail.com, if you are interested to know more about me. 

The majority of the coding/programming that I partake on usually is on a private repository and during the rest of the day out of work, I tend to not code as much and concentrate on reading.
I would like to increase my coding at an incremental steps and store whatever that I have learnt from my studies. Hopefully, it will be help me retain knowledge on patterns and ML concepts.
