- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Asfvin. I am currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer in an Insurance Company. Previously a Data Scientist
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in extracting and generating value from data
- ðŸ“« How to reach me. Please email me at asfvin.p@gmail.com, if you are interested to know more about me. 

The majority of the coding/programming that I partake on usually is on a private repository and during the rest of the day out of work.

I use this repo for my practicing some of the tutorials in Master Classes
